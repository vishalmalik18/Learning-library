classfication value performance evaluating
n by n number of classes
correct class

Actual Values compare to predict value.
True class 
postive neagative 
True posative = predict value and actual value is True.
True Neagative = value is Falas and modle false.

False posative = value is False but predict value is True Type 1 error
False posative = value is True but model predicat false value

Accuracay
The no of predication that the model got right
formula Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN) = 80+100/200 = 0.9

Error Rate
The no of predications that the model predicted wrongly
Error Rate = (FP+FN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) = 15+5/200 = 0.1

precison
when the model predicts the positives how often is it right.
precision = TP/(TP+FP)=80/95=0.86

Recall
When it's actually yes,how often does it predict yes?

Recall =(TP)/(TP+FN)=80/85=0.94
